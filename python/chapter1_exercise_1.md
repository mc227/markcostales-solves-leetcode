the task is to write an essay about how algorithms are important to my everyday life


i am a software dev (non comp sci)
- i work with people who know it
- i use algorithms all the time
- the people whom i work with who know it i see how good they are

after reading chap 1 i'm starting to see the importance of it
- i'm studying for the ccna and i can break down the tasks better
- i can see like in normal everyday tasks the how they can be viewed as algorithmes
	- like cleaning the house. first clean here then here and then start over again

youtube
- raymond gan did 100 project euler questions before his flatiron bootcamp
- raymond jones did 1000 leetcode questions and he found all of his first round/second round technical screens to be easy

finally i've been putting of learning this i feel like i'm gonna do it anyway
i've been a software developer for the past 5 years (with more than 3 of those years writing code during that time i've been wanting to do it)
