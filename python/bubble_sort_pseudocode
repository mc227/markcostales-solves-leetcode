given an array

first we get the lenght of the array. we're gonna use this is a for loop


this is the first for loop based on the length of the array
    here we set the state of the iteration of the forloop as haven't been swapped
    here is the inside for loop
        bascially here we compare each element beside each other in this for loop
        if the element on the left is bigger than the one of the right then we swap them
        we alseo change the swap state as being swapped if this if statement gets triggered
    
    if the state of the swap doesn't chagne if the swap never occurs we get out of the for loop

finally we return the array. it should be correctly sorted by the time we return it
